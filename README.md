# Credit Analysis - Data Scientist Challenge

This project consists of a credit risk analysis using real data from a financial institution, aiming to compare traditional credit granting policies (AS-IS) with a Machine Learning-based approach (TO-BE).

## Objective

- **AS-IS Policy:** Automatically reject any person aged 28 or younger.
- **TO-BE Policy:** Use the score from a binary classification model to approve or reject clients, maintaining the same rejection rate as the AS-IS policy.
- **Financial Analysis:** Calculate the size of the approved portfolio, total debt, and the savings generated by adopting the TO-BE policy, considering only the month of August 2017.

## Main Steps

1. **Data Loading**
   - Datasets: train, test, and OOT (out-of-time).
   - Data downloaded directly from a public repository.

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Checking variable types, missing values, and variable distributions.
   - Temporal analysis and analysis of categorical and numerical variables.

3. **Preprocessing**
   - Date conversion and extraction of month/year.
   - Removal of columns with many missing values.
   - Imputation of missing values.
   - Encoding of categorical variables (OneHotEncoder).
   - Normalization of numerical variables (RobustScaler).

4. **Modeling**
   - Training a RandomForestClassifier model with a preprocessing pipeline.
   - Adjustment to handle class imbalance (`class_weight='balanced'`).

5. **Evaluation and Financial Analysis**
   - Generation of probability scores for good payers.
   - Calculation of the AS-IS policy (age > 28) and TO-BE policy (score).
   - Calculation of the amount lent, total debt, and savings generated.
   - Focus on the test set for August 2017.

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas requests matplotlib seaborn numpy scikit-learn
   ```

2. Run the `analise_exploratoria.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.

## Expected Results

- **AS-IS approved portfolio:** Total amount lent to clients older than 28 years.
- **AS-IS total debt:** Total defaulted amount by these clients.
- **TO-BE approved portfolio:** Total amount lent to clients approved by the model, maintaining the same rejection rate.
- **TO-BE total debt:** Total defaulted amount by these clients.
- **Generated savings:** Difference in debt between the two policies.

## Notes

- The pipeline is ready to be easily adapted to other models (e.g., XGBoost).
- The project can be expanded with new features, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and model explainability.
